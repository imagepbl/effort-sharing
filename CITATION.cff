  This package combines a variety of data sources to compute
  fair national emissions allocations, study variability,
  and compare results with NDC estimates and cost-optimal
  scenario projections.

  - Gather country-level data (population, GDP, historical
  emissions, etc.) 

  - Compute global future emission pathways based on
  configurable scenarios 

  - Calculate allocations for countries/regions using
  various effort-sharing rules 

  - Compare allocations, NDCs, and cost-optimal scenarios 

  - Conduct variance decomposition (Sobol analysis)
